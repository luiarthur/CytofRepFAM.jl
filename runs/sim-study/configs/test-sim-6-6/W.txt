# Comments:
# In conjunction with Z.txt,
# this W, makes the first (similar) 
# features in sample 1 (first row) absent
# in the other sample. The first two
# features in sample 1 are rare, and the
# third feature is prominant. The first
# three features are similar. We want
# to see if the two rare features get merged
# into the similar but prominant feature (3).
# Moreover, feature 1 is absent in sample 2.
# Features 4 and 5 are similar, but not
# prominant or absent in sample 1.
# Feature 5 is distinct, and prominant in 
# sample 1. We expect it to be recovered 
# easily. Feature 7 is rare (to absent in one
# sample). We hope it can be recovered because 
# it is so distinct.
