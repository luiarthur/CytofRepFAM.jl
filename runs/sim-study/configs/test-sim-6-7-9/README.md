# Experiment test simulation 6.7.9

This experiment tests the performance of intrinsic MCMC (iMCMC).

Notes:
- N=(20000, 20000). Note that 6.7.8 uses N=(2000, 2000).
- phi = (0, 1, 10)
- `dataseed` = (1, 2, 3)
- `mcmcseed` = (1, 2, 3)
- iMCMC will be fast, but we also hope it helps with mixing, and recovers the
  simulation truth well.
